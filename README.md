# Frontend Test Assignment

[Figma mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/L0NUuF0qAjNAkhGc0upBDB/Frontend_Internship?node-id=2%3A604&t=yR560xVot0xEHgQ4-1)

## Getting started
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now we’d like to check your React and TypeScript skills with a test assignment. You will have to create a small web app based on the mockups in Figma. 

The test assignment is to build a small web app according to the mockups in Figma. 
Please, create a GitHub repo based on this template and continue working with it. 

Design notes:

•	The layout should be mobile only. No need to handle desktop screen resolutions.
•	It should be 100% of the window width but at most 600px.
•	The image for the user avatar and the loader icon are located in the /public directory of the template repository. All other assets you should export from Figma on your own.

Implementation notes:

•	Use the project structure from the template.
•	Use api/index.js to mock the API calls. Also, rewrite it on TypeScript. Remember that API service should be extendable. Consider that all API endpoints will have similar response structures.
•	Implement joinClassNames() function (utils/joinClassNames.ts) and try to use it in your code.
•	Use functional components.
•	Use react-hook-form to build the login form. It’s not required in small apps, but we’d like to see how you work with it.
•	Validate the email format before submitting the form. Avoid complex expressions, check @ existence, at least one symbol before and at least one symbol after it.
•	Highlight email and password text fields in case of incorrect credentials.

You have 10 days to complete the test assignment. When you are ready, send a link to the repo in a reply to this email. 

Good luck!
